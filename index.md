# Welcome.

I don't really have any good ideas on what to do with this site at the moment. The best one I have right now is a guide to the *Fate* franchise, so that is what I will do. Enjoy.

*Note: This will be covering mainly the entries that I know, a majority of which are the anime adaptations of the originals. This is not an extensive guide on everything from the series, not only because I don't know it all, but because it would also take far too long.*

## Fate/stay night

*Fate/stay night* is the first entry in the series, a Japanese visual novel released on January 30th, 2004 by Type-Moon. 

*Note: A **visual novel** is a type of interactive novel originating from Japan, played on PCs. It allows the players some choices within the story that can lead to different endings, although a majority of the experience is just text, whether it's narration, dialogue, inner monologues, or something else.*

The story follows Shirou Emiya, a Japanese high school student that falls into the world of magecraft through the *Holy Grail War*, a battle between 7 mages over the omnipotent wish-granting device, the Holy Grail. Each mage is given a familiar, called a Heroic Spirit, that is a famous figure from the past or even the future, summoned to the present to fight.

The most important thing you need to know when it comes to the basic structure of *Fate/stay night* is that the game can be split into 3 separate routes that the player can take, leading to different events and endings within the story.

These routes are:
- **Fate**
- **Unlimited Blade Works**
- **Heaven's Feel**
